# Edge Desk

A Kalshi market scanner, live trade tape, order books, fee-aware edge/Kelly math and a paper-trading desk, served from a single Cloudflare Worker. The Worker also relays Kalshi's public, read-only market-data API (Kalshi refuses browser requests directly), so the page works on any phone or desktop with no backend of your own.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/adamthabo/hello/tree/main/edge-desk)

## Deploy

**One click:** press the button above, sign in to Cloudflare (free plan is fine), accept the defaults and deploy. Your copy lives at `https://edge-desk.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.

**Dashboard:** Workers & Pages → Create → Start with Hello World → replace the editor contents with `edge-desk.worker.js` → Deploy.

**Terminal:** `npx wrangler deploy` in this folder.

## Optional settings (Worker variables)

- `RELAY_KEY` — when set, the relay only answers requests carrying `?k=<key>`; the app's Setup view has a field for it.
- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` — lock CORS to one origin instead of `*`.

## Real trading (optional)

Add three secrets to the Worker (Settings → Variables and Secrets) and the Desk view gains your real Kalshi account: balance, positions, resting orders, and a real-money ticket with a confirmation step.

- `KALSHI_KEY_ID` and `KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY`: an API key from Kalshi → account settings → API Keys (Ed25519 or RSA; paste the whole PEM).
- `DESK_PASSWORD`: a password you choose; the page asks for it once per device.
- Optional `MAX_ORDER_CONTRACTS` (default 100) and `MAX_ORDER_DOLLARS` (default 100) cap any single order; `KALSHI_DEMO_KEY_ID` / `KALSHI_DEMO_PRIVATE_KEY` enable the demo exchange.

The private key never leaves the Worker: it signs each request there, and the account routes answer only the page served by this Worker, with the password. Orders are sent as price-capped limit orders (fill-or-cancel by default) through Kalshi's V2 order endpoint.

## Trading engine (optional, real money)

Desk → Engine runs a "line anchor" strategy inside the Worker (a Durable Object with its own SQLite journal, woken every minute by a cron trigger): it matches Kalshi game markets to sharp sportsbook lines from the-odds-api.com, devigs them into fair probabilities, takes Kalshi's price when it is off by more than fees plus a margin, otherwise rests bids below fair value, pulls quotes before kickoff, holds to settlement, and journals every bet with the probability it believed (Brier score vs the market).

- Add the secret `ODDS_API_KEY` (the-odds-api.com). Optional `NTFY_TOPIC` for push alerts via ntfy.sh.
- Limits live in the Engine tab: bankroll, per-game and total exposure, daily loss stop (auto-off + cancel), margins, sports. The Worker's `MAX_ORDER_*` caps still apply to every order.
- `wrangler.toml` declares the Durable Object binding, its SQLite migration and the cron trigger; deploying once with it is required before the Engine tab works.

## What the relay does and does not do

It forwards `GET` requests for a short allowlist of public endpoints (`/markets`, `/events`, `/series`, `/markets/trades`, orderbooks, candlesticks, exchange status) to `external-api.kalshi.com`, caches responses for a few seconds and adds CORS headers. It holds no API key and cannot place orders or read an account. Real trading happens on Kalshi.
